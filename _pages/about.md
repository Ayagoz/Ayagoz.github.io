About me
------
I'm a 28 y.o. the woman from Kazakhstan. As a bachelor's degree, I finished Kazakhstan Department of Moscow State University 
named after M.V.Lomonosov, Mathematics faculty with an honor degree. At the end of my bachelor's degree, I met a topic 
related to Data Science and completed the first course of Data Science in the Russian language. That was 
the point where my relationships with Data Science started. I passed exams by winning the Olympiad to 
HSE University to Computer Science faculty to Master's Data Science (DS) program. I am fond of courses of 
theoretical and provable parts of DS because it correlates with my Bachelor's degree.
I learned a lot of applications and last researched approaches to complex data (such as graphs). While my
education at HSE I started my first job as a Researcher at the IITP RAS lab "Data analysis in neurosciences". 
It combined my two passions: computer science and neuroscience. My academic experience included participation
in the MICÐ¡AI conference with poster and oral speech. You can find my papers in the `Publication` chapter. 
However, I liked the experience of growing my hard skills, so I started my first commercial job at 
[Constanta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/constanta-tech/?trk=ppro_cprof&originalSubdomain=ca). 
I wanted to develop my skill in the area of Computer Vision and the task I worked with at Constanta included 
real-time video segmentation and recognition, tracking and detection. I have had a great experience and 
learnt a lot of practical skills (hard and soft). My path led me to a startup called Halbestunde. It is an app 
that helps junior musicians to read notes and detect mistakes in their play. As far as it is a startup
I had to make a lot of management and infrastructural work: settings for git-flow, setting for work-flow, 
defining the technical task, etc. Startups have their aesthetics, yet I wanted to see what it is like to 
work in a big company. While my interview processes and test tasks I had experience not only with computer vision
tasks but with audio.  I joined the Department of smart voice assistant Marusya at VK company.
