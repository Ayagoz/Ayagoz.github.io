‚ú® About Me
------
I'm a 31-year-old data scientist from Kazakhstan, currently based in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mathematics with honors from the Kazakhstan Department of Moscow State University (named after M.V. Lomonosov). Toward the end of my undergraduate studies, I discovered my passion for Data Science after completing my first course in the field. That interest evolved into a career when I won an Olympiad that secured my admission to the Master‚Äôs program in Computer Science (Data Science track) at HSE University in Moscow.

Throughout my academic journey, I gravitated toward the theoretical aspects of data science, particularly those intersecting with complex data structures such as graphs. This aligned with my research work at the IITP RAS lab ‚ÄúData Analysis in Neurosciences,‚Äù where I explored graph-based generative models and brain MRI analysis. My academic efforts led to presentations at top-tier conferences like MICCAI.

Eager to translate my research skills into real-world applications and because of burn out of the science work, I transitioned into the commercial sector. At Constanta (was OSAI AI, now part of SportRadar), I engineered computer vision systems for real-time video segmentation, object tracking, and player recognition in both esports and basketball contexts. I then joined the startup Halbestunde, where I not only tackled audio and visual recognition tasks but also led the implementation of development workflows and infrastructure ‚Äî a unique opportunity to blend engineering, planning, and product thinking.

Later, at VK‚Äôs voice assistant team Marusya, I worked on audio classification and segmentation, optimizing internal tools and improving evaluation metrics. Lately, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at Akvelon, focusing on large language model (LLM) applications, MLOps, and intelligent assistant development using RAG, Langchain, and ReAct frameworks. I‚Äôve also introduced performance monitoring systems (Grafana, Prometheus) and developed prompt optimization pipelines.

### Latest Position (2025)
#### Principal Machine Learning Engineer: Anecdote AI ‚Äî Remote

At Anecdote AI, I lead the development of core features that power agentic, LLM-based research workflows:

    üöÄ Deep Search: Designed, implemented, and shipped a state-of-the-art agentic search system delivering 40% more accurate summaries compared to the baseline. I managed the full lifecycle from architecture to deployment.

    üìä Quantify: Built the Quantify feature ‚Äî an automated system for extracting and quantifying structured insights from natural language data. Developed and maintained both integration and end-to-end test coverage to ensure robustness.

    üîç RAG System Optimization: Managed the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enhance context retrieval accuracy ‚Äî improving performance on 80% of evaluation cases.

    üß™ Testing Infrastructure: Set up and maintained comprehensive test suites (integration + E2E) for key components, ensuring high reliability in production.

This role has combined technical leadership, LLM engineering, and deep product understanding ‚Äî all in a fast-paced, high-impact startup environment.

Across both academia and industry, I enjoy bridging theory with application ‚Äî whether in vision, audio, or language ‚Äî and am passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.
